# COVID-19--Data-Exploration-

The project focuses on exploring the Covid 19 data using SQL queries. The project revolved around 2 tables imported to the database: CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations. The tables provided information about COVID-19 cases, deaths, population, and vaccinations across different locations and continents.

After importing the datasets from Excel to SQL , worked on data exploration skills, using basic sql queries as well as some advanced queries such as joins, CTE and temp tables.
Through this project, I have tried answering the following -

> Liklihood of dying if you contract Covid (in India)

> Percentage of Population that got covid (in India)

> Countries with highest infection rate

> Countries with highest death count per population

> Continents with highest death count per population

> Globally total cases, total deaths and death percentage

> Total Population vs vaccination

Thanks to Alex Freberg for this tutorial and datasets.
